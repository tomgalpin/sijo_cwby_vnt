		<p class = "lineSpacing" style = "padding-top: 0; padding-right: 30%;"> Chris Pouliot is a real life rocket scientist, who has also spun astronauts until they were motion sick, split atoms to make an aircraft carrier go fast, provided insightful analysis that led to Google to change their top ad color, and helped Netflix determine what movies and TV shows to buy, and how much they should pay. In his free time, he enjoys being an advisor to start-ups (including awesome ones from Cowboy).<br><br>

		Cowboy’s portfolio companies are great to work with – they super smart and as an added bonus, super nice!  They understand the need for data and analytics to help optimize their business – so that makes it easier for me to help them fill in the details. </p>
