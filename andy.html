		<p class = "lineSpacing" style = "padding-top: 0; padding-right: 30%;"> Andy has spent the last 7 years helping consumer startups figure out how to grow, having previously been a product manager and internet marketer working on user growth and engagement for Facebook, Twitter and Quora. Today I'm an EIR at Greylock and working on figuring out what I want to do next. <br><br>

		I like working with Cowboy ventures because the team is fun and sharp, decision-making happens quickly when it comes to figuring out which companies we want to invest in and help grow, and I'm able to have a meaningful impact on our portfolio companies by sharing my knowledge with them. </p>
